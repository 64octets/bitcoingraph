# Prerequesites

## Bitcoin Core setup and configuration

Install the current version of Bitcoin Core, either from [source](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) or from a [pre-compiled executable](https://bitcoin.org/en/download).

Once installed, you'll have access to three programs: `bitcoind` (= full peer), `bitcoin-qt` (= )


bitcoingraph accesses blockchain data via the Bitcoin client's JSON-RPC
API. So first, make sure that the [Bitcoin Core client][bc_client] is running on your machine. Try

    bitcoind -printoconsole

Second, make sure that your bitcoin client accepts JSON-RPC connections.


## Other requirements

Make sure Python 3.4 is installed on your machine

    bitcoin-graph git:(master) âœ— python --version
    Python 3.4.0
